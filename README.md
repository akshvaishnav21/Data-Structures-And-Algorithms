To build out an A* implementation in Python.

There are only a few important changes:

1. Include a target for the search to find. No more searching in all directions for all destinations.
2. Collect and return the shortest path. A dictionary of distances is cool and all, but A* is on a mission to get you to your target destination and tell you how to get there.
3. Build a heuristic that calculates the estimated distance between two points. This is the crucial point of difference between Dijkstra's and A*; A* has a real sense of direction.

The A* algorithm is a greedy graph search algorithm that optimizes looking for a target vertex.
A* is a modification of Dijkstraâ€™s done by adding the estimated distance of each vertex to the goal vertex when searching.

The runtime of A* is O(b^d) where b is the branching factor of the graph and d is the depth of the goal vertex from the start vertex.
